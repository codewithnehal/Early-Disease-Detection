# ‚ù§Ô∏è Early Disease Detection (Heart Disease)

This project predicts the likelihood of **heart disease** based on patient data. It includes **EDA, preprocessing, and classification models** (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) with evaluation using **Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1, ROC-AUC, and Confusion Matrix**. The best model is saved for future predictions.

## üìå Project Overview  
The goal of this project is to build a **classification model** that detects early signs of **heart disease** using demographic, lifestyle, and health-related attributes. It demonstrates the complete pipeline of **data exploration, preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and model persistence**.

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  - Handling missing values  
  - Encoding categorical features with **OneHotEncoder**  
  - Scaling numerical features with **StandardScaler**  

- **Classification Models:**  
  - Logistic Regression  
  - Decision Tree Classifier  
  - Random Forest Classifier  

- **Model Evaluation Metrics:**  
  - Accuracy  
  - Precision  
  - Recall  
  - F1 Score

## üìä Dataset  
- Contains patient data such as **age, cholesterol, blood pressure, chest pain type, etc.**  
- Target column: **`disease`** (1 = has heart disease, 0 = no disease).  
- Works with CSV/Excel or Google Sheets.
